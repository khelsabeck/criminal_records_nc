# felony_records_nc

__Description:__
My name is Keith Hinkleman Helsabeck, and I am an attorney licensed in North Carolina and a web developer. I have ten years of experience handling primarily criminal law, and am also a licensed patent attorney. This package is intended for NC attorneys reviewing criminal records and determining a client's record level for Misdemeanor, Felony, and DWI, as well as for examining and timelining habitual felony status from a record. It is not a substitute for legal advice or the judgment of an attorney, and I admonish anyone accessing this package that this package is not a self-help tool for defendants.
