__Description:__
My name is Keith Hinkleman Helsabeck, and I am an attorney licensed in North Carolina and a web developer. I have ten years of experience handling primarily criminal law, and am also a licensed patent attorney. This package is intended for NC attorneys and clients reviewing criminal records and determining a client's record level for Misdemeanor, Felony, and DWI.
